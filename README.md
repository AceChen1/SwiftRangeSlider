This is a swift implementation of custom UIControl that allows users to select a range of values on a slider bar with 2 knobs.

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 7.3+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build SwiftRangeSlider.

To integrate SwiftRangeSlider into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

use_frameworks!
target '[your_app_name]' do
  pod ‘SwiftRangeSlider’
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
